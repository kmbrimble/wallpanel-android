# WallPanel (kmbrimble fork)

Android kiosk browser for a Home Assistant dashboard, running on a wall-mounted
tablet on the home LAN. The app holds HA credentials (and optionally MQTT
broker credentials), so trust in every change matters more than usual for a
hobby project.

## Why this fork exists

- **TheTimeWalker/wallpanel-android** is the original project. Maintained
  2022-2025, archived May 2025. Last SDK bump was to Android 13 in Oct 2023.
  Our tablet currently runs this build and crashes frequently — that's the
  problem we're fixing.
- **Darknetzz/wallpanel-android** forked it after the archive and modernised
  the build: Gradle 9.x, Kotlin 2.x, current AGP, JDK 17-25, Android SDK 34,
  Firebase/Play Services made conditional on `google-services.json` being
  present, and prod/dev product flavours. Darknetzz's own README states the
  fork is "not yet fully working" and some features may be unfinished or
  unstable — treat anything touching network/TLS/storage with extra scrutiny
  until verified.
- **This fork (kmbrimble/wallpanel-android)** is forked from Darknetzz, not
  from the archive, because Darknetzz did the SDK/toolchain modernisation work
  we need. We build and maintain our own fixes on top of it.

See `REVIEW.md` for the full security/reliability diff assessment between the
archive baseline and Darknetzz's master, and its go/no-go recommendation.

## Remotes

- `origin` — kmbrimble/wallpanel-android — this fork, where we push our work.
- `upstream` — Darknetzz/wallpanel-android — our fork's parent; pull
  Darknetzz's fixes from here.
- `archive` — TheTimeWalker/wallpanel-android — the archived baseline
  everything descends from. Kept for history/diff comparison only, not for
  merging.
- `plus` — 000-i/wallpanel-plus — a parallel fork, kept around for future
  comparison only. **Do not merge anything from it** without a separate
  review.

## Build

```
./gradlew assembleProdDebug
```

- **Flavours**: `dev`, `qa`, `prod` (flavour dimension `"default"`). Use `prod`
  for anything installed on the actual tablet; `dev`/`qa` pull build-time
  config (HA URL, MQTT broker/credentials) from `local.properties` via
  `buildConfigField`, which is convenient for local testing but means those
  fields end up in the DEV/QA `BuildConfig` — never install a dev/qa build
  outside a throwaway test device.
- **JDK**: Gradle itself runs on JDK 17-25; Kotlin/kapt compile against JDK 17
  via `kotlin { jvmToolchain(17) }`.
- **Android SDK**: `compileSdk`/`targetSdk` 34, `minSdk` 19.
- Firebase Crashlytics / Google Services plugins only apply if
  `google-services.json` exists in the module — safe to build without it.

## Standing constraint

**We build and sign our own APKs.** Never install a prebuilt APK/AAB from a
release page, CI artifact, or third party, even from `upstream` — build from
source we've reviewed and sign with our own key.

## Git workflow

Commit and push to `origin master` automatically once a change is complete
and verified (build succeeds / tests pass as applicable) — do not stop to ask
for confirmation first. This applies to normal working commits on this repo.
Still ask first for anything destructive or history-rewriting (force-push,
reset --hard, rebase, branch deletion) and for tags/GitHub releases tied to a
signed APK release, since those are harder to unwind.

## Delegation

- **advisor (Fable)** is consulted for: the plan, before implementation begins,
  on any feature touching more than one file; any decision about concurrency,
  lifecycle, teardown or threading; anything touching credentials, network
  config or permissions; any judgement call where two reasonable approaches
  exist; and a review of the diff before the feature is declared done.
- advisor is **not** consulted for: naming, formatting, mechanical edits, or
  anything where there is one obvious answer. Over-consulting wastes time and
  dilutes the signal.
- **repository-reader (Haiku)** handles all exploratory and high-volume
  reading: locating code, enumerating call sites, reading diffs, scanning
  dependencies. Do not read large files directly when repository-reader can
  summarise them.
- When advisor's recommendation is not followed, say so and why in the
  handback.

## Release signing

`assembleProdRelease` produces per-ABI split APKs plus a universal one. **Sign
and install the `arm64-v8a` split, not the universal APK** — our tablet is
arm64-v8a only, and the split is 19.6MB against the universal's 36.1MB for the
same install. Build tools live at `/root/.android-sdk/build-tools/34.0.0/`.

Verified signing invocation:

```
zipalign -p -f 4 <unsigned-arm64-v8a.apk> <aligned.apk>
apksigner sign --ks /projects/wallpanel-release.jks --ks-key-alias wallpanel \
  --ks-pass file:/projects/.env.keystore-pass --out <signed.apk> <aligned.apk>
apksigner verify --print-certs --verbose <signed.apk>
```

- The keystore password lives at `/projects/.env.keystore-pass`, **outside the
  repo** — never move it, or a copy of it, into the repo or commit it anywhere.
- `apksigner sign` also emits a `<signed.apk>.idsig` sidecar file — this is a
  Play-specific artifact (APK Signature Scheme v4). **Do not attach it to
  releases**; only the signed `.apk` itself.

## Deploy and verify — release policy

This app is a personal wall panel, not critical infrastructure. Auto-promotion
on green tests is deliberate — do not add confirmation prompts before
promoting.

- **Verify on `xyz.wallpanel.app.kmb.dev` first**: both `scripts/smoke-device.sh`
  and `scripts/smoke-renderer-crash.sh` (the latter with its idle wait intact —
  never weaken, shorten, or skip it to get a green) must pass against a debug
  build from the same source tree as the release.
- **If both pass, promote automatically**: install the signed arm64-v8a APK to
  the production app `xyz.wallpanel.app.kmb` —
  ```
  adb -s 192.168.0.52:5555 install -r <signed-arm64-v8a.apk>
  ```
  The tablet is reachable over the LAN at `192.168.0.52:5555` (adb-over-TCP;
  `adb connect 192.168.0.52:5555` first if it isn't already listed in
  `adb devices`).
- **If either script fails, do not promote.** Report and stop.
- Keep every promoted APK at `release-out/WallPanelApp-arm64-<versionName>.apk`
  and attach it to its GitHub release. **Never delete older ones.**
- **Rollback (manual, by the user only)**:
  ```
  adb install -r -d release-out/<older>.apk
  ```
  The `-d` flag is required — adb refuses a lower versionCode without it.
